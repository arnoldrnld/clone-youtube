# Youtube clone

A frontend clone of the classic YouTube UI built using HTML and CSS. 

This is my first project that I have created in my learning journey of html and css.

#### I learned:
- CSS grid
- flexbox
- position and alignment
- text styling
- pseudoclasses and elements
- transition
- semantic tags

and many more while actually doing this project.
